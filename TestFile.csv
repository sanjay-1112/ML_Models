"Got the green version of the iPhone 11. Easily the best phone I've ever owned. The slightly thicker bezels, lower screen resolution, and IPS LCD technology really don't bother me and I am extremely impressed by how gorgeous the screen really is. Super happy with my choice!\n\nAlso, does anyone actually notice a difference between the A12 and A13 SoC? I have the A12 on my iPad Air 3 and literally cannot tell the difference with my more-powerful iPhone."
Guys I have Iphone 6s and I wanna Upgrade any suggestion 11 or  11pro
"I mean it get it. It works for a lot of people who just can‚Äôt use anything but iOS. I just can‚Äôt make due with that screen, it‚Äôs even a downgrade coming from a 7+"
Nice Video against I phone.
I want to buy I phone as well as I am interested to buy one but I really like this best I phone and I think let's see....and as well I really like your video on interior review best against I phone.....
Everyone: I just upgraded from an 6/6s\nMe: watching it while crying in 2020 with an iPhone 6
I can never unsee the green alien
watching this just to clariy my purchase
I just bought an Iphone 11 and will return it. Everything is so good except when playing videos in facebook or youtube. The videos are so grainy.  The display is LCD.  My 4yr old Galaxy S7 has super amoled and is a way better screen.
